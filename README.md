# Amne_avm
Pricing model for house sales in Seattle, WA


To run the automated valuation model, download the entire repository (including the data) locally. Navigate to the "Code" directory, change the permissions so you can run it (type "chmod +x ./amne_avm_peabody") in terminal, and then type "./amne_avm_peabody" in terminal. Follow the prompts from there. Note that this model has only been trained on homes with fewer than 20 bedrooms, square footage under 7000, and lot size under 20000 square feet in King County, WA. Any accuracy metrics in the Jupyter notebook are not applicable to homes outside these parameters.
